# Constructing a branch predictor simulator for SPECint95 benchmarks

University of Central Florida, Department of Computer Science, CDA 5106: Fall 2020 

Machine Problem 2: Branch Prediction

In this project, you will construct a branch predictor simulator and use it to design branch predictors well suited to the SPECint95 benchmarks.

The problem description can be found in "MP2_Instructions.pdf" and the results of the simulation is in "report.pdf"

BranchPredictionExperiments folder contains code that automates running multiple runs and report the results in csv file
